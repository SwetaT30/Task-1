# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

# Project Name - Customer Personality Analysis

# Overview

Customer Personality Analysis involves thoroughly examining a companyâ€™s ideal customers. It enables businesses to gain deeper insights into their audience, making it easier to tailor products to meet the distinct needs, behaviors, and concerns of various customer segments.

Tools Used : Excel

I imported the "Customer Personality Analysis" dataset from kaggle in CSV format and converted it into MS Excel format in order to perform the process of Data Cleaning and Preprocessing.
Then, I updated the headers of all the Columns, changed their font style, size and colour.
Next, I applied filters on all the columns and checked if there are any duplicate values in the dataset by selecting the entire ID Column from the dataset and clicking on the 'Remove Duplicates' Option from the Data Tab.
Then, I changed the format of 'Income' Column to 'Accounting' Number Format, 'Customer's Enrollment Date' Column to Short Date and did some more formattings.
In 'Eductaion' and 'Marital Status' Columns, I removed the null values and replaced some repetitive values by using the 'Find and Replace' option.
In this way, I gained hands-on experience in identifying and fixing common data issues like missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting and thus, I built confidence in handling raw datasets independently.
